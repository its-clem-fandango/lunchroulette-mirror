# Lunch Roulette

Lunch Roulette is an app that randomly connects two people for a friendly lunch date.

It can be hard to get to know people in a community when you don’t have a shared reason to spend time together.

Lunch Roulette solves this initial awkwardness by giving people a way to meet each other. You can create a profile, indicate when you’re available for lunch, and the app will assign you a lunch.
